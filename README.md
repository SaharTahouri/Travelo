# Directory Expalanation
This project has been implemented once using pure CSS and Sass, and once using Bootstrap 5.3 classes and styles. In the "css version" directory you can see the pure version and in the "bootstrap version" directory you can see the version bootstrap's been used in. The goal here was to implement exactly the same appearance as the pure version using Bootstrap.
